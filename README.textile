h1. fiveruns.dash.django package

FiveRuns Dash recipe for Django, packaged as a Django App
* See http://dash.fiveruns.com

h2. Status

This package is currently under active development, and is not ready for production.  It is being tested against Django 1.1 (SVN) and @manage.py runserver@, and has not been tried with @WSGI@, @mod_python@, or other production methods.

At this point the package is being released purely as a technical preview (feedback being highly sought).

h2. Installation

Standard installation via @setuptools@ (and @ez_setup.py@)

  $ sudo python setup.py install
  
You may need to manually install "the fiveruns.dash package":http://github.com/fiveruns/dash-python first.
  
h2. Configuration

Add @fiveruns.dash.django@ to the end of @INSTALLED_APPS@ in your @settings.py@:

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    'fiveruns.dash.django'
  )
  
Next you must set @DASH_TOKEN@ to a valid application token (provided at http://dash.fiveruns.com):

  DASH_TOKEN = 'YOUR-APP-TOKEN'
  
You may also want to set the log level, at least temporarily, for debugging purposes (by default it is set to @logging.WARN@):

  import logging
  DASH_LOGGER_LEVEL = logging.DEBUG
  
For additional options, see the Django portions of the "Python Language Guide":http://dash.fiveruns.com/help/python.html
